</h3><h4>http://cleveland.craigslist.org/cto/4758395326.html</h4></header><p style= width: 400px>I have a 1993 Dodge Stealth for sale. It starts right up, it runs, it drives- I drove it consistently last winter.  Was fairly decent in the snow for a sports car-front wheel drive. Newer alternator and battery.  Automatic, power windows, power locks, working HD radio/cd player, good brakes. Interior in pretty good shape. Has engine oil leak-not too bad, and needs power steering line replacement-badly-fluid runs right out .  Some parts and panels were switched prior to my ownership with 3000GT parts and some do not match or line up like they should-paint not in good shape.  Front tires have slow air leak: was told problem with the rims, corrosion?-last time I brought it to tire shop they re-sealed them and it lasted about 6 months.  Passed emissions and no check engine or other warning lights. Has heat, but AC is not working.
